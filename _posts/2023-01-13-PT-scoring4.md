# Hacks
Create a blog post with your score and reasoning for each performance task submission. Review the score given by the AP scorers and reflect:
- on any discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring
- on what your program will need to fulfill all requirements
- on the criteria and why a submission may have failed to meet the standard
