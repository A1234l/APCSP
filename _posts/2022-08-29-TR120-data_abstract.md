title: Data Abstraction in Python
description: A computer application without data is typically simple and not very useful.  Think of all the fields in Computer Science that are related to data.  This week, using Pair Programming, students will get familiar with storing data in Python.

# Data Abstraction - Week 2
As you use Python, as with all programming languages, <mark>managing data is a key skill</mark>.  Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Or in other words, something that is easier for the developer to understand.  Data Abstraction ,along with Procedural Abstraction, are the keys making successful programs.  Data Abstraction is vital when sharing data amongst developers, sharing data across the internet, or working in technologies like BioMed, Data Science, etc.
- <mark>Variables are a way to name, store, data and reference data</mark>.  We have started working with variables in our last sprint.  Lists and Dictionaries are variables with extended features for storing and retrieving data.
    - <mark>Lists, think of [] square brackets</mark>, are a way of grouping data in an ordered sequence, and will be a big part of the requirement for the College Board Create Task project.  All students will need to become proficient in lists to do well in the class and succeed in the AP exam.
    - <mark>Dictionaries, think of {} curly braces</mark>, are a way of grouping data into in key-value relationships.  Dictionaries are similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  Knowledge of Dictionaries and JSON is key to Web Development.


## Daily Plans Week 2
Introduce some concepts in [Big Idea 2 Data](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3), [Big Idea Section 3.2 Data Abstraction](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3).  Practice Pair Programming Habit of 30 minutes/30 minutes/1 commit.
- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs: show personal progress in Python, Variables, and Assignments.
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Lists and Dictionaries.  
- Wednesday: Tech Talk - Pair Programming and using Jupyter Notebook to generate Python lists and dictionaries
- Thursday: Tech Talk - HTML fragments, including behind the Scenes Layout
- Friday: Code/Code/Code - Code/Code/Code, Completing hacks for the week


# Points and Tangibles
- Points (see canvas), live reviews will be scheduled in class on Monday of next week.  Everything will be crossover graded using a "Review Ticket"
    - Individual/Pair
        - _notebook: "Lists and Dictionary Pair Programming"
        - _posts: "HTML fragment notes"
        - demo/code review of Github Pages / Fastpages original work
