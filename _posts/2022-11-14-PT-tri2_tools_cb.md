## Trimester 2 Pre-Holiday Objectives
> Unit 2 and Unit 3 mastery.
- Students needs to master Big Idea 3 Algorithms and Programming from College Board online curriculum prior to winter break.
- Students should master Unit 2, topics 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4 before winter break.
- Teams will share a lesson.
    - Every team must present and be clearly involved in preparation.  Review tickets are required for each student with links to tangibles.
    - In lesson preparation and teaching students should try to use Binary as data in lessons.  All algorithms need data and there are many applications of Binary that can support the Algorithms from College Board Unit 3 
     - Exceptions can be made to Binary.  But, this must be discussed with Teacher in advance.
- Students will be work with Fastpages, Jupyter Notebooks: python, javascript kernels, also it is ok to have challenges as Frontend JavaScript code in Fastpages (similar to Binary example that is shown at the beginning of the trimester).
- At the end of the Trimester students will be expected to present Fastpages/Blog with Homework assignments and a FE Binary application.

## Trimester 2 Post-Holiday Objectives
> Create Performance Task completed.
- After additional Data and Algorithm mastery in initial 5 weeks of trimester... students and teams will transition to "Create Performance Task" projects.  12 hours of class time will be allocated to this task over the final 7 weeks.  Additionally, you will use this project in Trimester 2 N@tM presentations.  
    - Be sure to have an interactive portion to this project
    - During the 7 weeks we will be learning to our APIs and processes with Upload (images), creating Frontend forms, storing forms in Databases, learning Login and Security.  Additionally, you should be able to comment as well as like posts.
    - Plan your Create Performance Task with these features in mind. FYI, 1-4 people can work on a project, but everyone must have there own feature that represents all the College Board requirements.
    - Also, we will have Career Tech, AP Test and Human Development Tech Talks during the last 7 weeks.

## Plans Week 13
> Weeks Plans
- Monday: Form Teams, Pick Teaching Topic, Setup Team, Carry over or establish Team repositories, Establish scrum board, Verify Tools and Kernels.  
- Tuesday: [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/0/) minute 0 to minute 50 to provide background on binary, complete all 50 minutes recommended
- Wednesday: Binary Logic and Abstractions
- Thursday: Work Day
- Friday: Tools and Issue Verification

## Tools and Issue Verification (3 points)
> Summary of Points.
- Individual Tools Verification, VSCode, JavaScript and Python Kernels working on Laptop/Desktop.  "Python Jupyter Notebook" and "Javascript Fastpages MD files will be key technical platforms.  If you have problems currently, go back and re-install tools from 1st trimester guide.  Be sure VS Code is running out of Anaconda environment.  Perform make server to pretest prior to commits.  Show ***running code*** in Fastpages for as is Binary md. 
- Plan Individual Binary Logic and Abstraction Hacks.  Create ***Individual Issue*** with checkboxes. Look at Hacks for Binary Logic and ALgorithms and build all issues that you interpret as valuable/required!!!  Plan something new.  Consider redesign and how many different md files you will need.
- Plan Team Lesson and Issue(s) Plan, requires checkboxes
    - Consider lessons for Week 14,15,16, consider using Binary project to supplement learning.  Consider other CTE Topics/Hacks for week.  Coordinate with other Teams for the same week, all projects should be coordinated in Python Notebooks or Fastpages Md on the same week.  Coordinate on Homework.
    - Objective in each lesson is to teach Algorithm and key Data topics at the same time.  Make sure Jupyter Notebook or FE code is created for homework.
