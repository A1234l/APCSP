## Exam Preparation
1. TAKE THE NOTES! I know the Collegeboard videos are not the most interesting thing and a lot of them cover topics you may already know from class, but just taking simple notes may come in handy when you need to review towards the end of the tri. Also taking notes is very helpful for remembering overall concepts which means LESS REVIEW NEEDED LATER!
2. TRY ON THE QUIZZES AND PRACTICE TESTS! They are great practice, and searching up the answers is definitely not the way to go. 
3. QUIZ AND TEST CORRECTIONS! They are a great way from you to learn the information if you didn't learn it from the video. 
4. BUT MOST HELPFUL (FOR ME)...[Khan Academy Videos!](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles) I found that these videos were super helpful when I needed to review something really fast, but didn't want to go to collegeboard. I really thought the videos/assignments on the internet were very effective for me. I think its a great resource to use just to review the topics that you are super confused or just want more clarification about.

## Create Task Preparation

1. Read over the [instructions](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf) carefully, and make sure that you are including each specific element in your project.
2. Review the past examples that CollegeBoard provides.
