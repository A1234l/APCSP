## Agile Development
> It has been said: ***if you want to produce the same result, do the same thing over and over again***.  Well, this Teacher thinks it is time for a change.   Thus, we are going to scale our Agile Development process to slightly larger teams.

## EOY project
> Objective of each presentation Teach key Data Structure / AP Content.  Here are some of the Teacher ideas.
- Build a learning site, using Full Stack capilities.  
- Login and Identification is not be required initially but it will be taught before EOY.  Learning site should be specific to user.
- User should be able to interact with your Web Site and learn a key CompSci topic
- Topics should come from materials we have learned from the year, they should enhance or improve Teacher topics, adding more depth, your specific interests, and creativity.
- Topics should have a Teaching system to conduct a lesson, lab to be performed, and plan for hacks/grading.
- Topics should have Web based presentation and interaction, this portion will be really important at N@tM where you will be showing you topic/learnings for about 3 minutes.
- Topic Options
     - Developing Frontend/Backend Application (Big Idea 1)
         - Setting up GitHub Pages project for Frontend
         - Buiding requirements for an API using Scrum Board
         - Fetching content using JavaScript, HTML, CSS
         - Developing Backend APIs using Python, Flask

     - Data Analysis including Numpy and Pandas, Frontened and Backend (Big Idea 2)
         - Looking for deeper analysis, like predictive analysis
         - Make sure we discuss approval on depth
     - A Guide to Binary Math, truth tables and logic (some code and hacks to be provided) (Big Idea 2)
         - Building Simulations/Interactions using Binary Math

     - Data Structures including List, Dictionaries, 2D arrays and Iteration (Big Idea 3)

##  Agile and Roles
> We will deviate from the picture slightly.
- Every group of 5 - 7 will have a Product Owner/Manager, these people will be final say on requirements for the project.
- Every group of 5 - 7 will have a Technical Lead / DevOps Lead.  These people will guide team in technical task, according to Product Owner requirements.  They will provide guideance or starter code for everyones tasks.  They will ask Teacher to assist on technical research or clarifications on things team is having trouble solving.
- Each group of 5 - 7 will have a Scrum Master, and there will only be one Scrum Master for entire team.  These people will alert Product Owner, Technical Lead or Teacher of an obstacles in getting work done.  
- Remaining 2 - 4 Developers, roles of Front End, Back End, or topic expert will be given.
- Roles are not final and adaptations could be made through the trimester to promote function.  Everyone needs to CODE, CODE, CODE!!!
