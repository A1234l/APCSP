title: Data Abstraction Sprint - Python
---

# Introduction to Python - Week 1
As you use Python, managing data becomes a key skill, as with all programming languages.  Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Or in other words, something that is easier for the developer to understand.
- Variables are a way to name data and reference data.  We have started working with variables when we discussed Anatomy of Python.
- Lists are a way of grouping data and will be a big part of the requirement for the College Board Create Task project.  All students will need to become proficient in lists to do well in the class and succeed in the AP exam.
- Dictionaries are a key and modern way of grouping data into in key-value relationships.  Dictionaries is similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  Knowledge of Dictionaries and JSON is key to Web Development.
- Data Abstraction ,along with Procedural Abstraction, are the keys making successful programs.  
- Data Abstraction is vital when sharing data amongst developers, sharing data across the internet, or working in technologies like BioMed, Data Science, etc.

## Daily Plans Week 2
Introduce some concepts in [Big Idea 2 Data](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3), [Big Idea Section 3.2 Data Abstraction](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3).  Practice Pair Programming Habit of 30 minutes/30 minutes/1 commit.
- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs: show personal progress in Python, Variables, and Assignments.
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Anatomy of Python.  
- Wednesday: Tech Talk - Fastpages, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown	: Tour of working on _posts and _notebooks.
- Thursday: Tech Talk - Focus and Habits, video frm Yale
- Friday: Code/Code/Code - Pair Programming in Jupyter Notebook.  

# Points and Tangibles
- Points (see canvas), live reviews will be scheduled in class on Monday of next week.  Everything will be crossover graded using a "Review Ticket"
