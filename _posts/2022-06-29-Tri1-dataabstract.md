title: Data Abstraction Sprint - Python
---

# Introduction to Python - Week 1
As you use Python, managing data becomes a key skill.  Data abstraction is the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. 
- Variables are a way to name data and reference data.  We have started working with variable when we discussed Anatomy of Python.
- Lists are a way of grouping data and will be a big part of this lecture.
- Dictionaries are a key and modern way of grouping data into in key-value relationships.  

## Daily Plans Week 1
Discuss some concepts in [Big Idea 3 Algorithms and Programming](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3).  Always Code/Code/Code in classroom when schedule allows!  Practice Pair Programming Habit of 30 minutes/30 minutes/1 commit each and start of "Personal Computer Plan".  Here is a resource that can help you do a [Python Overview](https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/python/python-overview/), though use Jupyter Notebook and VSCode instead of the suggested IDLE.  If you use this resource, try to create something that looks similar to their website; this will teach you how to design based off of what you see.
- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs: show personal progress in setting up tools with Teacher.
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Anatomy of Python.  
- Wednesday: Tech Talk - Fastpages, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown	: Tour of working on _posts and _notebooks.
- Thursday: Tech Talk - Focus and Habits, video frm Yale
- Friday: Code/Code/Code - Pair Programming in Jupyter Notebook.  

# Points and Tangibles
- Points (see canvas), live reviews will be scheduled in class on Monday of next week.  Everything will be crossover graded using a "Review Ticket"
