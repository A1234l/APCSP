                <li>Introduction is on equity. 50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP</li>
                <li>Follow up dates.  Saturdays 10/15, 11/19, 1/28, 3/18</li>
                <li>Met Ken Toma (Canyon Hills, SD), Faith Yeaton (San Gabriel Academy, Pasadena area), Ms O'Masters (Central Valley)</li>
                <li>Worked with Sean Yeung who is new to my school :).  I would like to see a lot of him this week.</li>

                        <mark>What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan?</mark>
                        Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary.  Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which are leading to 1's and 0's that students will see in future.  Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... "to make sure the work gets done".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <mark>What are 2 things you have questions about? </mark>
                        I believe 15-18 age group should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time listed for this lesson plan (45 minutes).  Elaboration on this would seem like a fall back for me for the few in my school that don't get binary directly.  IMO, binary should be taught in detail when needed, my plan is to teach it through <a href="https://csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/starter/rgb/">color codes</a> and through <a href="https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/frontend/binary">binary calculator</a>; the later inspired by Harvard CS50.  IMO, in modern languages and frameworks we don't want to lead students down the binary grind until they get interested in CS or binary as part of an application solution.  College Board seems to have delayed this to Big Idea 2 and teaches concepts around data abstraction and data compression.

                        <mark>What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson?</mark> 
                        Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5w7_UnVIGHOdkqCtK2O78rQ7JJFAWlOeZkZNsCovOY/preview#heading=h.p7ous6j4l1b8">course vision</a>.  I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic.  Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other.  Perhaps, for our event it is more about Collaboration from Big Idea 1 then Binary in Big Idea 2.

### Monday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm
> Binary Number System <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tc7ymjq38gzfWj86jq5dJPh7Ra40e20Gz9g3eHLELnY/edit#slide=id.gf4186ef409_0_997">slide #99</a>.  The activity requires paper and Teacher thinks analog experience is important.  Connect Circle-0 / Square-1.  Teacher recognizes different experience level but thinks everyone should create flippy-do.  Code.org vocabulary is last, but not to be ignored.
- Relation is focussed on these concepts
    - 0-9 are symbols for numbers in Base 10
    - 0-1 are symbols for numbers in Base 2
- Make an adaptation to support Flippy-Do information: [Binary Calculator](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/frontend/binary)
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048 game</a> might be interesting development activity to relate to binary.
- This is a general slide on all lessons <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tc7ymjq38gzfWj86jq5dJPh7Ra40e20Gz9g3eHLELnY/edit#slide=id.gf4186ef409_0_1299">slide #121</a>.
- Color Codes inserted into these lessons seems key to me
