                        Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary.  Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which is leading to 1's and 0's that students will see in future.  Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... to make sure the work gets done

                        <mark>What are 2 things you have questions about? </mark>
                        I believe 15-18 should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time, this seems like a fall back for the few in my school that don't get binary directly.  IMO, binary should be taught when needed, like in talking about color codes; in modern languages and frameworks we don't want to bog students down into a binary grind until they get interested in CS.  I like that it is in Unit 2 in College Board.

                        <mark>What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson?</mark> 
                        Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or course vision.  I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic.  Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other.
