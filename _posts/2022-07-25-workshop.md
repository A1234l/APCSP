                <li>Introduction is on equity. 50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP</li>
                <li>Follow up dates.  Saturdays 10/15, 11/19, 1/28, 3/18</li>
                <li>Met Ken Toma (Canyon Hills, SD), Faith Yeaton (San Gabriel Academy, Pasadena area), Ms O'Masters (Central Valley)</li>

                        <mark>What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan?</mark>
                        Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary.  Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which are leading to 1's and 0's that students will see in future.  Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... "to make sure the work gets done".

                    <li>
                        <mark>What are 2 things you have questions about? </mark>
                        I believe 15-18 should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time listed for this lesson plan (45 minutes).  Elaboration on this would seem like a fall back for me for the few in my school that don't get binary directly.  IMO, binary should be taught when needed, my plan is to teach it through color <a href="https://csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/starter/rgb/">codes</a> and <a href="https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/frontend/binary">binary calculator</a>; the later inspired by Harvard CS50.  IMO, in modern languages and frameworks we don't want to lead students down into a binary grind until they get interested in CS or binary in an application.  College Board seems to have delayed this to Big Idea 2 and teaches concepts around data abstraction and data compression.

                        <mark>What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson?</mark> 
                        Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5w7_UnVIGHOdkqCtK2O78rQ7JJFAWlOeZkZNsCovOY/preview#heading=h.p7ous6j4l1b8">course vision</a>.  I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic.  Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other.  Perhaps, for our event it is more about Collaboration from Big Idea 1 then Binary in Big Idea 2.
