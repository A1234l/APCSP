            Code.org is sponsor.  Lesson are from published <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5w7_UnVIGHOdkqCtK2O78rQ7JJFAWlOeZkZNsCovOY/preview">Curriculum Guide</a>.

            <ul>
                <li>Introduction is on equity. 50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP</li>
                <li>Follow up dates.  Saturdays 10/15, 11/19, 1/28, 3/18</li>
                <li>Met Ken Toma (Canyon Hills, SD), Faith Yeaton (San Gabriel Academy, Pasadena area), Ms O'Masters (Central Valley)</li>
                <li>Worked with Sean Yeung who is new to my school :).  I would like to see a lot of him this week.</li>
                <li><a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2022/lessons/3">Lesson 3 Plan</a>

                        <mark>What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan?</mark>
                        Circle and square patterns is a lite intro into binary.  Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, which are leading to 1's and 0's that students will see in future.  Group work is used, as one Teacher said in our session... "to make sure the work gets done".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <mark>What are 2 things you have questions about? </mark>
                        I believe 15-18 age group should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time listed for this lesson plan (45 minutes).  Elaboration on this would seem like a fall back for me for the few in my school that don't get binary directly.  IMO, binary should be taught in detail when needed, my plan is to teach it through <a href="https://csp.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/starter/rgb/">color codes</a> and through <a href="https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/frontend/binary">binary calculator</a>; the later inspired by Harvard CS50.  IMO, in modern languages and frameworks we don't want to lead students down the binary grind until they get interested in CS or binary as part of an application solution.  College Board seems to have delayed this to Big Idea 2 and teaches concepts around data abstraction and data compression.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <mark>What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson?</mark> 
                        Since we are starting in a lesson, I would like to see 12 weeks or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s5w7_UnVIGHOdkqCtK2O78rQ7JJFAWlOeZkZNsCovOY/preview#heading=h.p7ous6j4l1b8">course vision</a>.  I feel like this is a very isolated and simple topic.  Though, it is an easy thing for Teachers to get to know each other.  Perhaps, for our event it is more about Collaboration from Big Idea 1 then Binary in Big Idea 2.

### Monday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm
> Binary Number System <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tc7ymjq38gzfWj86jq5dJPh7Ra40e20Gz9g3eHLELnY/edit#slide=id.gf4186ef409_0_997">slide #99</a>.  The activity requires paper and Teacher thinks analog experience is important.  Connect Circle-0 / Square-1.  Teacher recognizes different experience level but thinks everyone should create flippy-do.  Code.org vocabulary is last, but not to be ignored.
- Relation is focussed on these concepts
    - 0-9 are symbols for numbers in Base 10
    - 0-1 are symbols for numbers in Base 2
- Make an adaptation to support Flippy-Do information: [Binary Calculator](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSP/frontend/binary)
- The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048 game</a> might be interesting development activity to relate to binary.
- This is a general slide on all lessons <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tc7ymjq38gzfWj86jq5dJPh7Ra40e20Gz9g3eHLELnY/edit#slide=id.gf4186ef409_0_1299">slide #121</a>.
- Color Codes inserted into these lessons seems key to me, or some other purposeful element, encryption was mentioned by Teacher.  In general, not seeing "why?" in Code.org lessons as we start... but the appear in the high level description.

> Compare Unplugged and Plugged Lessons.
- What is teacher doing in unplugged lesson? encouragement, walking around, answering questions.  Unplugged is not computer: Stand-up meeting, White Board Design
- Let them Explore!!! Shared an idea of plugged lesson, shared a [tool](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2022/lessons/5/levels/1).  Don't lecture about it, as them what it does, what is happening?

> Teachers role is described as [Lead learner](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tc7ymjq38gzfWj86jq5dJPh7Ra40e20Gz9g3eHLELnY/edit#slide=id.gf4186ef409_0_1400). We may not know, but we can figure it out.  My response to questions...
- Lead learner allows diverse activities in classroom
- Lead learner may provide completely different work for student with special interests or special needs.
- Teacher (Jennifer) suggested she needs to build the computer science muscle, including suffer confusion. Student (Patrick) mentioned that students see straight into your capability.
- Different rhythms for different students.
- Blogging Platforms mentioned
- Peer Feedback mentioned
- Pair Programming mentioned

> Actions for inclusive classroom culture
- Group thought it is more on capability versus culture
- Student (Sonya) talked about doing multiple media types (paper, digital)
- Student (Patrick) discussed audio and video slides for virtual
- Student (Ken Toma) give everybody a voice.  Suggested pair-share can provide that platform

> Async work
- This video discusses a lot of what I believe in and will kickoff PBL well.  I think it popped up by accident but it was cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s29LKfEFjQ
- Watched the place, mostly it has a place to complete async activities and surveys.  It says I am not enrolled when I attempt survey.
- [The Place](https://place.fi.ncsu.edu/course/view.php?id=455) introduced.

### Tuesday Morning Session 9 - 11 am
> Module 2 Intro [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YJ2yVORINceJTyQvI3S-rzORzODR15NDEnpRocjBT0M/edit#slide=id.g131c6789885_0_1768)
- USC represented shared [Web Site](https://viterbik12.usc.edu/code-org/usc/)
-  Unit 1 Lesson 7. Played with B/W Widget, on building black and white images.   Idea was good on 1st couple of exercises, it quickly seemed to become tedious.  I am not sure how it would related to key concepts in CB and not happy with it in PBL (except if we add improvement or design elements).  Interaction could be improved to maintain orientation of Hexadecimal to lines. Maybe coding improvement could be to preserve orientation and allow clicking on pic, binary, or both.  This exercise in driver navigator would make a lot of sense.  Worked with Jp Fletcher, Jason Mahoney, Manuel Hernandez
- Unit 1 Lesson 8. Color Images Widget, I like this for the 1st lesson more.  It seems like the stair step is not significant and perhaps this might provide more joy.  Somewhat a combination of two lessons would make me happier, perhaps one black/white and then color would be good for interactive lecture.

```
- Course Framework page 16, computation thinking practices and big ideas.  Learning objectives and essential knowledge.
- Async was on Big Ideas, Computational Thinking practices,...  In my experience I focus in on covering the Big Ideas.  Students don't seem to relate will to other weightings.  Also, I focus on CTE principle of College Ready through test and Intern ready through PBL.  If we teach them to build stuff a lot of the other things fall out.

### Tuesday Afternoon Session 1 - 3 pm
> Kickoff was reviewing scavenger hunt.  People generally have questions as new teachers.
- Teacher (Katie) reviewed CB outline.  My experience is by doing CB MCQs and PBL, the students think questions are easy/basic.
- Next (Katie) covered the Code.org outline.  Unit 1-3 cover Big Idea topics in 1, 2, 4.  Units 4-7 cover Big Idea 3.
- Some discussion on block coding vs scripted in Create Task Project.  

> Transition to Unit 1 Lesson 9-10 Lossless/Lossy Compression.  Widget Bubble 1
- Played with Text to Symbol compression, Ken Toma came up with multiple words.
- Spoke on introduction, we instructed Patrick to look for associations to make this interesting.
- Lossy compression had a reduction widget
- Lossy compression had a pick quality slide voting
- Summary on these, widgets and ideas are great for intro, but they don't seem to have depth that I like in the lesson.  I want people to learn how to do these.
