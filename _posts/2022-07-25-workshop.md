                <li>Introduction is on equity.  50% girls in school should mean 50% enrollment in CSP</li>
                <li><a href="https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2022/lessons/3">Lesson Plan</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are 3 things you notice about the lesson plan? Circle and square patterns is a softball into binary.  Number 7 and permutations of squares and circles are showing representations, leading to 1's and 0's they will see in future.  Group work is used.</li>
                    <li>What are 2 things you have questions about? I believe 15-18 should be able to combine this with binary lesson in same amount of class time.  Perhaps a lack of vision in this activity for students as they don't know binary is coming.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing you are interested to find more about or are excited about when you look at this lesson? I would like to see a greater vision for 12 weeks or topics, don't isolate things.  IMO, binary should be taught when needed, like talking about color codes.</li>
