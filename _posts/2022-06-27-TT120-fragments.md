## HTML Fragments and Markdown
Building an entire Web Application frontend requires HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  In our Fastpages/GitHub Pages a lot of the frontend design work has been done.   Jekyll takes our choice of layouts in our _config.yml file (theme: minima), along with our HTML and Markdown fragments and build a complete static website.


### Web Page Layout
A complete HTML Web Application is typically made off of a Layout and a series of Fragments (sometimes called templates).  
- [Web Page Layout](https://padlet.com/jmortensen7/weblayout).  This illustration becomes important when you make your own layout and fragments using frameworks like Jinja2 (for Python)  or Thymeleaf (for Java).
- [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), has a layout as shown below.  Everywhere you see an "include" this layout is including a fragment to complement the page, things like CSS and JavaScript.  Where you see ```{{ content }}```, this is the statement that includes page specific HTML or Markdown fragment.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ page.lang | default: site.lang | default: "en" }}">

  {%- include head.html -%}

  <body>

    {%- include header.html -%}

    <main class="page-content" aria-label="Content">
      <div class="wrapper">
        {{ content }}
      </div>
    </main>

    {%- include footer.html -%}

  </body>

</html>
```
- The design of GitHub pages allows us to change themes with the _config.yml file (theme: minima) key/value, change the value to  a [supported theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/) should just work.  The new them will have a similar layout and ```{{ content }}``` statement that will include our HTML or Markdown fragments.

### Alert to Students
Students <mark>spending tons of time writing custom CSS will be counter productive</mark> to College Board goals and CTE goals for this class.  Be aware that HTML style is important, but we are trying to focus more on utilizing framework to maximize success in the style area.   Developers, particularly new Developers, need to ensure they are spending time in all the key technical of instruction.  <mark>Pair Programming and Team Programming are aids in speeding up learning</mark>, these collaborative techniques are not defer learning to others!!!

### Review these Fragments
#### Table Fragments
In Fastpages you can build a table in HTML or Markdown.  
- The index.html file builds a table with HTML
- The _posts/**pseudo.md file builds a table with Markdown

#### Images
In Fastpages you can insert images in HTML or Markdown.  The Teacher finds ```<img>``` easier to work with for embedding links and controlling size.
- See index.html for ```img``` usage

#### Links
Look up ```<href>``` and ```[]()`` syntax in both HTML and Markdown.  These should become easy and familiar.

#### Tagging
Make sure to use tagging and make it provide a nice index into your information under "Tags" menu.  Here is sample.
```html

## Hacks
At the end of this week you should have your theme, index.html and multiple external references in your site.  
- Time Box fragments are very important to show what you have done each week.  I want to see cumulative personal history for the Trimester and for the Year.
- You should be able to show how you have considered naming an Tagging to help you find materials under categories.
- You should be able to show home you have considered search and how you are able to find key elements.
