## HTML Fragments and Markdown
Building an entire Web Application frontend requires HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  In our Fastpages/GitHub Pages a lot of the frontend design work has been done.   Jekyll takes our choice of layouts in our _config.yml file (theme: minima), along with our HTML and Markdown fragments and build a complete static website.


### Web Page Layout
A complete HTML Web Application is typically made off of a Layout and a series of Fragments (sometimes called templates).  
- [Web Page Layout](https://padlet.com/jmortensen7/weblayout).  This illustration becomes important when you make your own layout and fragments using frameworks like Jinja2 (for Python)  or Thymeleaf (for Java).
- Minima Layout, everywhere you see an "include" this layout is including a fragment to complement the page.  Where you see ```{{ content }}```, this is where our HTML or Markdown fragment is inserted.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ page.lang | default: site.lang | default: "en" }}">

  {%- include head.html -%}

  <body>

    {%- include header.html -%}

    <main class="page-content" aria-label="Content">
      <div class="wrapper">
        {{ content }}
      </div>
    </main>

    {%- include footer.html -%}

  </body>

</html>
```
- The design of GitHub pages allows us to change theme and the new them will have a similar ```{{ content }}``` statement that will include our code and hopefully style us within there layout.
