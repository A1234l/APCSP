# Computer Bias
Earlier we talked about beneficial and harmful effects of computing.  Such conversation often lead to conversations on computer bias, particularly when bias creates a harmful effect.

As programmers, you now have the possibility of creating algorithms.  It has been said, "Humans are error-prone and biased".  So, does that mean algorithms and the computers they run on are better?

### Intentional or Purposeful bias
* Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion?  Is it harmful?  Should it be corrected?  Is it good business?
* Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful?  Is it harmful?  Should it be corrected?  Is it good business?
* Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers?  Is it harmful?  Is it good business?

### Blog Post Reflection
* Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
* Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you.  Here are some ideas...
    * Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
    * If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
    * How do you think this happened?
    * Is this harmful?  Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
    * Should it be corrected?
    * What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
