## Start with a Comment
> Every person listening involved in this lecture needs to comment on this blog...
- How should I improve on to improve my software deliverables?


### Quality Method and Mantra
> `Agile` fits in the process of building a quality software engineering culture. Agile development can help teams prioritize and deliver software quality...
- Combining Agile and DevOps methodologies, you can further streamline processes to increase efficiency of development and delivery.
    - Issues with peer reviews
    - Small incremental changes
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). 
    - Continuous Improvement
- Teams can embrace quality culture by focusing on teaching and allowing suggestions instead of dictating orders and demanding changes. 
- Focussing on Customer/Teacher/Grader satisfaction is directly linked to a Teams quality cultures. 


### Suggestions for Quality
> In my recent evaluations of personal blogs I have noticed `a lack of commitment to quality` in personal work.  Definitions incomplete, out of date pages, incomplete review tickets, `not posting your score`.  Points from now and until the end of the year will be dependent on quality measures I see built into your process.
- Become a people who value quality in their software engineering culture and are committed to it.
- Prioritize quality and set realistic expectations for project deadlines.
- Educate the team on software quality and the importance of code reviews, automated testing, CI/CD and other elements of quality development. Ensure that source code is released only after it is verified with automated tests (tester methods).
- Embrace automation wherever feasible. Properly implemented automation can lead to better quality and productivity.
- Don't leave quality to just one member of the development team. Instill a culture that promotes quality from every position in the team.  Set quality goals.
- Encourage collaboration between different teams.  Review each other, even when not assigned.
- Establish metrics to measure and monitor quality -- identify potential improvement areas after each check point in the project.


## Hacks
> Quality 1st and Features 2nd will be keys to 2nd Trimester.  Each team role needs to establish quality goals.  To improve software quality it is important that all parties in the project have full understanding of quality requirements through fluid communication channels.  Thus, establishing a quality plan is a requirement.  Here are some ideas ...
- `Feature Focus` keep an up to date blog/readme on the features of your project.  The focus is to have 4 to 5 major features and the team should keep an up to date status of the progress of those features.  This includes how each feature meets all the criteria of College Board Create Task.  
- `Scrum Master` should have Team Member Issues and Customer/Teacher/Grader review ticket always in plan.  The review ticket should line up with Quality and Feature Focus.  Scrum Master maintain features/quality plan and holds team members accountable to plan.
- `DevOps` should have CI/CD goals.  Process should be able to identify failures when the occur and by what change.
- `Backend Developer` should have tester methods that don't depend on Frontend code or CI/CD process.
- `Frontend Developer` should establish full system checks before grading/reviews.  All system checks should be able to be performed on localhost frontend server.
