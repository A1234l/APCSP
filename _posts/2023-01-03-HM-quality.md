## Start with a Comment
> Every person listening involved in this lecture needs to comment on this blog...
- How should I improve on to improve my software deliverables?


### Quality Method and Mantra
> `Agile` fits in the process of building a quality software engineering culture. Agile development can help teams prioritize and deliver software quality...
- Combining Agile and DevOps methodologies, you can further streamline processes to increase efficiency of development and delivery.
    - Issues with peer reviews
    - Small incremental changes
    - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). 
    - Continuous Improvement
- Teams can embrace quality culture by focusing on teaching and allowing suggestions instead of dictating orders and demanding changes. 
- Focussing on Customer/Teacher/Grader satisfaction is directly linked to a Teams quality cultures. 


### Suggestions for Quality
> In my recent evaluations of personal blogs I have noticed `a lack of commitment to quality` in personal work.  Definitions incomplete, out of date pages, incomplete review tickets, `not posting your score`.  Points from now and until the end of the year will be dependent on quality measures I see built into your process.
- Become a people who value quality in their software engineering culture and are committed to it.
- Prioritize quality and set realistic expectations for project deadlines.
- Educate the team on software quality and the importance of code reviews, automated testing, CI/CD and other elements of quality development. Ensure that source code is released only after it is verified with automated tests (tester methods).
- Embrace automation wherever feasible. Properly implemented automation can lead to better quality and productivity.
- Don't leave quality to just one member of the development team. Instill a culture that promotes quality from every position in the team.  Set quality goals.
- Encourage collaboration between different teams.  Review each other, even when not assigned.
- Establish metrics to measure and monitor quality -- identify potential improvement areas after each check point in the project.


## Hacks
> Each team role needs to establish quality goals.  To improve software quality it is important that all parties to the project have full understanding of quality requirement through a fluid communication channel.  Thus, establish a quality plan.  Here are some ideas ...
- `Scrum Master` should have Issue and Customer/Teacher/Grader review goals.
- `DevOps` should have CI/CD goals
- `Backend Developer` should have tester methods that don't depend on Frontend code.
- `Frontend Developer` should establish full system checks before grading/reviews.
