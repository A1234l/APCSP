## Instructions to Download Visual Studio Code Remote - WSL
> Windows is the number one desktop operating system.  However, Linux is a preferred standard for many developers.  Using WSL you can develop in a Linux-based environment, use Linux-specific tool chains and utilities, and run and debug your Linux-based applications all from the comfort of Windows.  This gives the developer on Windows the best of both worlds.

### Download WSL 
> This section of the document is intended to get the WSL distribution of Ubuntu installed on you Windows PC.  
1. Type either Command or PowerShell (recommended shell) in your computer's search bar. Right click and make sure to <mark>Run as an administrator</mark>.
    - Correct Admin Prompt: ```C:\Windows\system32```
    - Incorrect User Prompt:  ```C:\Users\<username>```
        -  If you proceed to next command you will receive error```the required operation requires elevation```  You can elevate permission from this prompt using command: ```start-process PowerShell -verb runas```
2. Enter WSL installation command at Prompt:
```bash
wsl --install
```
3. As it states in output in shell, you will need to reboot your computer.  My suggestion is to select <mark>Restart</mark> or if available <mark>Update and Restart</mark>. 
4. After booting up there are several things that could occur
- A Command or PowerShell prompt could automatically pop up prompting you for a username. Choose a username and password to create an account.
- Some other event may occur.  Make sure you establish password when requested.  Verifying or take action in Command or Powershell, try these as ```C:\Users\<username>```...
   - Type ```wsl --list```, you should see Ubuntu
   - If no Ubuntu, Type ```wsl --list --online```, then use ```wsl --install -d Ubuntu```
   - After success
5. After WSL install, verify the following before you continue:
- Open Command or Powershell, <mark>as your own user account</mark>.
    - Type ```wsl```, this should put you in a different looking prompt. From ```C:\Users\<username>``` to ```<username>@MSI:```
    - If you ever need to elevate permission for installation ```sudo wsl```, followed by your computer password.
- Observe that drive changes from ```C:\``` to ```/mnt/c``` when you change prompt from native Windows to WSL.

### Download Visual Studio Code
> Installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the Remote extension lets you use the WSL as your full-time development environment right from VS Code
1. Install VSCode, [Download VSCode Windows Version](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. When prompted to Select Additional Tasks during installation, be sure to check the Add to PATH option so you can easily open a folder in WSL using the VSCode ```code``` command.
3. Install the [Remote Development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

### Opening up VSCode with WSL
1. Open a WSL terminal window (using the start menu item or by typing wsl from a command prompt / PowerShell)
2. Navigate to a folder you'd like to open in VS Code
Here are some useful command prompts to find a good location
```bash
cd ~     # takes you to your personal directory
mkdir    # creates a folder (you can name this vscode)  
ls     # views the content of the directory you are currently on
cd path     # changes the directory to the chosen path (you can also do cd ~/vscode)
cd ..    # changes the directory to the previous/parent directory
```
3. Type ```code.``` in the terminal. When doing this for the first time, you should see VS Code fetching components needed to run in WSL. This should only take a short while, and is only needed once.
4. Once finished, you now see a WSL indicator in the bottom left corner.
