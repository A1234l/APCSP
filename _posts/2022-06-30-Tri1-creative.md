# Creative Development - Week 3
In the Student handout... College Board states that Students need to obtain knowledge and skills that can include, but need not be limited to, "<mark>the iterative development process</mark>, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithmâ€™s purpose and explaining how it functions. <mark>A development process includes ideation, research, reflection, design, implementation, and testing your program</mark>.
- Scrum Board planning, revising plans, incremental goals, and iterative development are proven methods toward achieving a successful delivery.
- Pair Share team needs to work together to optimize delivery to Teacher. 
- Each student needs to become competent in HTML fragments, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python.
- Each student needs to begin technical application of College Board requirements in "Unt 2: Data" and "Unit 3: Algorithms and Programming".  

### Weekly Schedule
- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs: show personal progress in ideation and prototyping.
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Create Task.  
- Wednesday: Plan/Plan/Planning - Pair Create Task.
- Thursday: Tech Talk - Roles and Agile
- Friday: Code/Code/Code - Pair Create Task; suggest last 15-20 minutes for crossover grading 

### PBL Ideation
Start the process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding.  These are early ideas, followed by early coding (prototyping) helps lead Developers into the iterative processes of Development. 
- This should be done using Pair Programming.  You need to identify a Crossover Pair for reviews and grading.  Note, you will be graded on your grading.
- In this ideation process it is critical that you Review College Board Create Task project requirements.  For grading, you will be measured on how you are building knowledge toward that event.  As a pair you should consider this project as a viable option for your submittal.

### PBL Prototyping
The process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding.  Early ideas, followed by early coding (prototyping) helps lead Developers into the iterative processes of Development.
- One unique idea, aka something useful to your pair and/or something that helps you in school
- Show case work and labs from TPT and TT.
- A page that highlights YOU

### PBL Code/Code/Coding
This is bringing Ideation and Prototyping into something that has function.  Remember, user College Board Create Task requirements if you are struggling on details.

## Hacks - Live Crossover Grade, before Monday AM.
This is a big planning and prototype week,  Build all things into Scrum Board. Individuals demonstrate progress on assigned Issue(s) and then complete Issue(s)with tangibles.  
- DO NOT show up to a review without a Issue (Review Ticket) and linked Tangibles.
    - NEVER state that you don't have an Issue or Commit because you were helping someone else.  This statement will get you a 70% grade at best.
    - Provide Crossover/Self <mark>grade at the top of the Review Ticket</mark>.  Anyone who rates above 90% should have something they have done outside of the requirements. 
    - GitHub Page and Jupyter notebooks makes it easy to have a link to your own tangible(s) in a working document.
    - A high quality Issue will reflect Ideation, Prototyping, Code.  It is very easy to take 5 minutes a day to update your Issue before embarking into work.  This is called Daily Planning.  In fact, <mark>Daily Planning will help with your classroom focus </mark>.    
- Each Pair performs Review each week with crossover Pair, use review to see if Issue is complete
    - Crossover must make comments and grade within their comment, if individual has not done a crossover grade with comments they will receive 10% reduction on week.
    - Individual grade at top of issue should consider crossover grade, if score yourself higher than the grade you should show adjustment/corrections.
    - Individual will need to discuss grading and reflection/learnings from crossover grading during their presentation.
- Each pair should be prepared to complete review with Teacher in about 2 minutes.  Be prepared to both talk and take notes.
