# Creative Development - Week 3
In the Student handout... College Board states that Students need to obtain knowledge and skills that can include, but need not be limited to, "<mark>the iterative development process</mark>, strategies for collaboration, the development of both data and procedural abstractions, and describing an algorithmâ€™s purpose and explaining how it functions. <mark>A development process includes ideation, research, reflection, design, implementation, and testing your program</mark>.
- Scrum Board planning, revising plans, incremental goals, and iterative development are proven methods toward achieving a successful delivery.
- Pair Share team needs to work together to optimize delivery to Teacher. 
- Each student needs to become competent in HTML fragments, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python.
- Each student needs to begin technical application of College Board requirements in "Unt 2: Data" and "Unit 3: Algorithms and Programming".  

### Weekly Schedule
- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs: show personal progress in ideation and prototyping.
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Create Task.  
- Wednesday: Create Performance Task, Plan/Plan/Planning - Pair Create Task.
- Thursday: Tech Talk - Roles and Agile
- Friday: Create Performance Task, Code/Code/Coding, Pair Programming; Crossover Review last 15-20 minutes with crossover grading 

### PBL Ideation
Start the process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding.  Ideation are early ideas.
- One unique idea, aka something useful to your pair and/or something that helps you in school
- Show case work and labs from TPT and TT.
- A page that highlights YOU
- In this ideation process, it is critical that you Review College Board Create Task project requirements.  

### PBL Prototyping
The process of Ideation, Design, Scrum Board building, and assigning Issues prior to coding.  Early ideas, followed by early coding (prototyping) helps <mark>lead Developers into the iterative processes of Development</mark>.
- This should be done using Pair Programming.  A driver and observer, then switching.

### PBL Code/Code/Coding
This is bringing Ideation and Prototyping into something that has function and purpose.
- Issues and Coding should show progress to Create Performance Task requirements.  
- This is a Creative Development Sprint, it is not expected to be finished. However, it should show iterative progress.

### PBL Test
Projects should be tested.  Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements (Issues) being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.
- Test cases should be developed within Issue before software is fully developed.
- Testing and reviews can be combined with crossover grading.
- Self and crossover testing and grading should consider how your 'Unique idea(s)' matches your Issue(s).
- Undoubtedly, <mark>after this phase, new Issues are created</mark>; these issues represent changes that were not obvious when you started.

### PBL Development
At this point in time...  It should be obvious that Development and Coding are not the same thing.  Answer the question, "what is development?" or "why do they call people that code engineers?".  

## Hacks - Live Grade before Monday AM.
This is a big planning and prototype week,  Build all things into Scrum Board. Individuals demonstrate progress on assigned Issue(s) and then complete Issue(s)with tangibles.  
- DO NOT show up to a review without a Issue(s), Review Ticket and linked Tangibles.
    - NEVER state that you don't have an Issue or Commit because you were helping someone else.  This statement will get you a 70% grade at best.
    - <mark>Provide Crossover and Self grade at the top of the Review Ticket</mark>.  Anyone who rates their work above 90% must have something completed outside of the requirements. 
    - GitHub Page and Jupyter notebooks makes it easy to have a link to your own tangible(s) in a working document.
    - A high quality Issue will reflect Ideation, Prototyping, Code.  It is very easy to take 5 minutes a day to update your Issue before embarking into work.  This is called Daily Planning.  In fact, <mark>Daily Planning will help with your classroom focus </mark>.    
- Each Pair performs Review each week with crossover Pair, use review to see if Issue is complete
    - Crossover must make comments and grade within their comment, if individual has not done a crossover grade with comments they will receive 10% reduction on their score.
    - Individual grade and Crossover grade at top of Review Ticket is required. Make sure you do math on any rubrics provided, grade yourself on everything in the Canvas assignment.  
    - If you score yourself higher than the grade you received from Crossover, show how you made adjustment/corrections.
    - Individual will need to discuss grading and reflection/learnings from crossover grading during their presentation.
- Each Pair programming partnership should be prepared to complete their review with Teacher in about 2 minutes.  Focus is on Creative Development.
    - Be prepared to talk and accept feedback.
    - Focus on Review Ticket, Demo, Issues(s) completed, Failures, and New Issues Created
    - Optimize time for where you are the same.
    - Individuals should each speak to their own differences
    - Think about your vocabulary!!!  For instance, when you say development... know how it is different than coding.
