### How a Computer Works
> As we have learned, a computer needs aa prgram to do something smart.  At the heart of a computer is a Central Processing Unit (CPU). This component is essentially a binary machine focussing on instructions given to it by our programs.  The CPU stores the information as it acts upon instructions in its registors to Random Access Memory (RAM). Between CPU and RAM a computer can act on large amounts data that wouldnâ€™t all fit in the CPU and registers.
