            A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser.  Non-changing endpoints are used in interacting with server-side Web APIs.  RESTful web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text.
            <ul>
                <li>Server.  In this class, we will be using Python to define REST APIs that provide access to backend data. Python tools are very popular for building REST APIs</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Stateless: The server wonâ€™t maintain any state between requests from the client.</li>li>

                    <li>Client-server: The client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Client.  We will use JavaScript as the frontend to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs.</li>

                <li>Fetch will be used to make API calls.  There are four basic http methods:</li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>GET => Retrieve/Read data</li>
                    <li>POST => Create data</li>
                    <li>PUT/PATCH => Update data (put replaces the old one, while patch adds to the existing data)</li>
                    <li>DELETE => Delete data</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front-end of the API.  Python and Api libraries are used for RESTful API definition. APIs save a lot of time between developers, as exchange of data has expectations and standards.  Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech.
- Covid19: RapiAPI example.
- Jokes: Introduction to Python RESTful API library.  A list is used to make data persistent as long as Web Server is active.
- Users: Continues with RESTful API library, but now establish data persistence through the use of a database.
