    "> JavaScript has a very flexible syntax.  In the model we did at the beginning of the year we were making objects in JavaScript.  Though we were using the word ***function*** every attribute we similar to class we were designing in Python.  The ***this*** keyword performs same function as the ***self*** keyword in Python. In both languages referencing elements with this/self and ***dot*** notation allows access to attributes.  Look at JavaScript this.name, this.uid, ... below.  Also, a key element is this example is the Pseudo JSON that is output at the end.  JSON will be passed between Model and View using an API."
