    "    - Demonstrated in the video is a JavaScript/HTML/CSS program.  This program is used to Create and Read users.\n",
    "    - Users are displayed when the page is loaded.  The listing, which is in table format, contains common identity information required for a user/account system.  \n",
    "    - The information in the page is actually read from a different web application.  These users are retrieved from a backend system, an entirely different server and web application.  The users are stored in an SQLite Database and retrieved from this other web application via a backend Web API and endpoint, using a GET method\n",
    "    - Additionally, in the video shows the process for adding/creating new user information, this is with an API and enpoint use a POST Method.   After the POST, the information input on screen is validated and updated in the backend SQLite database, also it is updated on frontend Web page within the\n",

    "    - Initially, the JavaScript obtains input from the Web GET API, the response from the API contains JSON.   This JSON file is a collection containing a list of dictionaries which is iterated over in JavaScript row by row, each row outputs a corresponding row on the Web Page by generating HTML table data containing each user and their columnar data. \n",
    "    - Additionally, in the demonstration of creating new user information a WEB POST API enpoint is called.  In this case, the data is passed in the request body.  The backend API validates and unpacks the JSON data into a Python Object.  The Object contains the ability to Create a new row in the SQLite table.  After data is validated and created, it return success response to JavaScript, at that time the data input is displayed in the HTML table, add a row and columnar data for the new user."

The uo object, user object, is assisting in managing the complexity of the user data.  The method ```def post(self)``` checks data and add it to the uo object as it ensures only clean data enters the database.  Ei\n",
    "\n",
    "- explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list.\n",
    "    - The \"uo\" object, after it is created contains data from the user input, as well as a method to Create, ```uo.create()`` a record in the table.  The object activates code, through this method, that does not need to be throroughly understood by the implementor of the API.\n",
    "    - Additionally, there is a method to set the password, ```uo.set_password(password)```.  This method abstracts complexity of password encryption.\n",
    "    - Also, there is a method to set the date of birth, ```uo.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, '%Y-%m-%d').date()```.  Behind the scenes this calculates age of the user.\n",
    "    - Ultimately, after object is generated and all data is verified, the ```uo.create()``` method is called and a new row is committed into the database table.  In this step, all the commands required to interact with the SQL database have been abstracted.\n",
    "    - There are ways to write the ```class User``` code differently!  Primarly to make the code into a imperative sequence and perform everything done within the object in a serialized form of commands.  However, this would minimize the possibilities for code reuse.  For instance, in a ***User Management System*** there would be a need to ***Update*** user records, as well as this mentioned ***Create*** user record.   The user class and creating a ```uo``` object would similarly contain methods to support ***Update*** functionality.  For instance, the same  ```password``` and ```dob``` mutator/setter methods work for update.  Thus, an update API would be able to use these abstracted methods without a code modification or rewrite.   \n",
    "    - The concept of passing a list of Key/Value pairs through JSON, as illustrated with ```body``` variable is a foundation piece for REST API development.\n",
    "    - The concept of creating/updating a user object (```uo```) is common to Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  This enables the management of an Object (ie user object), which is a series of data elements, along with the code to  mutate and access that data in a reusable and reliable manner.  All things in code can be done in alternate ways, but OOP is great way to manage complexity on a list of attributes describing an object, aka user."
