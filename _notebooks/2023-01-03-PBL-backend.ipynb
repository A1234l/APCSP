    "> The project based learning objective is to create a purposeful backend, something that can't be done in frontend JavaScript.  A  database storing persistent data are a primary focus of most backend systems.  An SQLite Database using the Python SQLAlchemy framework is is the outcome of this lesson.  As students learn databases using SQLAlchemy, they will also learn about Object Oriented Programming in Python.\n",
